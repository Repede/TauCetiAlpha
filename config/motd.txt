<small>Tau Ceti Alpha is a branch of the Tau Ceti server family, with Baystation influence, which we do to maximize the variety of content for the server. Our administrators are active, and we regularly plan new, unique things to add!
<br>We also have special, non-human races available via whitelist. Please check our forums at http://tauceti.ru/forums/index.php for more information on playing as each race.</small>
